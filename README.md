🌐 Introduction

Retail operations like supermarkets face significant challenges in inventory control, sales tracking, and supplier coordination. Manual processes often lead to stockouts, poor decision-making, and customer dissatisfaction. This project introduces a robust Oracle PL/SQL-based solution to digitize and automate the management of supermarket operations — ensuring efficiency, transparency, and reliability through well-designed database components.

💡 Problem Statement

Supermarkets struggle with:

* Inconsistent stock levels
* Manual and error-prone order and invoice processing
* Limited performance analytics
* Lack of audit tracking for sensitive actions

This system resolves these issues using a full-featured Oracle database system with real-time stock tracking, invoice management, and supplier coordination, backed by security and audit features.

🎯 Project Objectives

* Automate core supermarket functions like stock, sales, and orders
* Ensure data consistency through constraints and triggers
* Provide analytical tools via PL/SQL functions and cursors
* Enable secure, traceable database operations
* Support real-time insights for inventory and financials

🛍️ Target Users

* Cashiers
* Store Managers
* Inventory Controllers
* Suppliers

🛠️ Database Features

📂 Tables:

* `CATEGORY`
* `PRODUCT`
* `CUSTOMER`
* `SUPPLIER`
* `EMPLOYEE`
* `INVOICE`
* `INVOICE_DETAIL`
* `ORDER_SUPERMARKET`
* `STOCK`
* `AUDIT_LOG`
* `HOLIDAY`

⚙️ Constraints:

* Primary keys
* Foreign keys
* Unique constraints
* Not-null constraints
* Domain-specific checks (e.g., `quantity >= 0`)

🔢 SQL Components

🔧 Procedures:

* `add_invoice_detail`: Automates inserting invoice items while updating stock.

💡 Functions:

* `get_invoice_total`: Calculates the total value of a single invoice.

👁️ Cursors:

* `low_stock_cursor`: Lists all products below threshold stock levels.

📦 Packages:

* `Supermarket_Package`: Bundles procedures/functions for inventory and billing.

🔐 Triggers:

* `prevent_dml_on_holidays`: Blocks stock/invoice actions on holidays.
* `log_user_action`: Inserts every sensitive DML into the `AUDIT_LOG`.

🔄 ERD – Entity Relationship Diagram

The ERD models the supermarket domain with entities for products, sales, suppliers, staff, and stock. Relationships include:

* Products belong to Categories
* Invoices involve Customers and Employees
* Orders link Products and Suppliers
* Stock updates automatically via Triggers

📌 Full ERD available in the documentation folder.

🧪 Sample Data

Names and values were adapted to realistic Rwandan context:

* **Customers:** Jean Bosco, Uwase Divine
* **Employees:** Alice Mukamana, Eric Niyonzima
* **Suppliers:** Niyonzima Suppliers Ltd, Kigali Wholesalers
* **Products:** Rice, Sugar, Tea, Soap

🧰 Tools Used

* Oracle Database 21c
* Oracle SQL Developer
* DBeaver (for visualization)
* GitHub (version control and documentation)

🔐 Auditing & Security

A custom trigger logs all updates and deletions in the `AUDIT_LOG` table with:

* Action performed (e.g., `DELETE`)
* User ID (from `EMPLOYEE`)
* Timestamp of the operation

A separate `HOLIDAY` table works with the `prevent_dml_on_holidays` trigger to stop critical changes on public holidays.

📈 Future Enhancements

* Mobile app integration for sales updates
* Real-time analytics dashboard with APEX
* Barcode-based scanning and product registration
* Integration with supplier portals for automated reordering
